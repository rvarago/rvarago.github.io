(WIP)
I stumbled upon an exercise to integrate a function involving trigonometric identities, it'd been
a while since I last did anything similar. So, I reckoned it'd be writing about it.

It's been years, perhaps far more than I'd like to admit, since I resolve an integration problem. I remember somehow having fun trying to find patterns in integrands that'd eventually lead me to an analytical solution.

Weeks ago I stumbled upon this exercise online:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} (\sin(x)^2 + \cos(x)^2) \, dx
\]
